              <p>Welcome to Girls Who Code College Loops at UW!</p>
                <p>We are a college campus organization where women (and those who identify as female)
                  who have attended Girls Who Code Club/Immersion Programs and people with an interest
                  in or passion for computer science and tech related fields can get together to learn,
                  support each other, and have fun. Our biweekly meetings include various professional
                  development activities with our corporate partners where you will learn about the industry
                  and expand cs skills, and sisterhood events where you will bond with your peers who are also
                  interested in tech and support each other on your journeys in the field.
                  Although being affiliated with Girls Who Code,
                  we do not restrict membership based on gender, and everyone is welcome to join. We are excited
                  to see you here!
